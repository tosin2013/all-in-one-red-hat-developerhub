To redo the README for the Red Hat Developer Hub and incorporate RHSSO and GitLab instead of GitHub, you can modify the steps to reflect the use of RHSSO for authentication and GitLab for repository management and webhook functionality. Here's a revised version of the README:

# All-in-One Red Hat Developer Hub GitOps Cluster Bootstrap with RHSSO and GitLab

This project repo contains a set of ArgoCD manifests and Ansible Playbooks used to bootstrap a Developer Hub Environment on top of OpenShift v4.x. The environment is designed for Developer workflows demo.

It uses the ArgoCD **App of Apps pattern** to pre-install and configure a set of OpenShift Operators to support Developer Workflows.

The following components will be provisioned by ArgoCD in your cluster:
 * **OpenShift Dev Spaces**
 * **Kubernetes Image Puller Operator**
 * **Git Webhook Operator**
 * **HashiCorp Vault**
 * **Vault Config Operator**
 * **OpenShift Pipelines**
 * **Patch Operator**
 * **...** (this list can grow as needed for future components)

## First Steps

1. **Fork and Clone**  
   [**Fork this repo**](https://github.com/redhat-na-ssa/redhat-developer-hub-gitops-bootstrap/fork) into your GitLab profile and **Clone it** locally.

## Setup a GitLab Group and Application

1. Create a new [**GitLab Group**](https://gitlab.com/groups/new). This group will contain the code repositories for the `components` created by Red Hat Developer Hub.

2. Set the following environment variables in a terminal:
```sh
K8S_CLUSTER_API=$(oc get Infrastructure.config.openshift.io cluster -o=jsonpath="{.status.apiServerURL}")
OPENSHIFT_CLUSTER_INFO=$(echo $K8S_CLUSTER_API | sed 's/^.*https...api//' | sed 's/.6443.*$//')
GITLAB_HOST_DOMAIN=gitlab.com # if using a self-hosted GitLab, replace gitlab.com with your internal domain.
GITLAB_GROUP=your-gitlab-group-name-here
GITLAB_GROUP_URL=https://$GITLAB_HOST_DOMAIN/$GITLAB_GROUP
```

3. **Create a new GitLab Application** to use the `Git WebHooks` functionality. Use the GitLab UI to configure a new application for the webhook system.

## Setup a Quay Organization

1. Create a new [**Quay Organization**](https://quay.io/organizations/new/). This organization will host the image repositories for the components created by Red Hat Developer Hub.

2. Generate a new OAuth token with the appropriate permissions in Quay and save it for later use in the environment variables.

## Setting up RHSSO (Red Hat Single Sign-On)

To handle authentication with RHSSO:

1. Deploy RHSSO on OpenShift following the [RHSSO Installation Guide](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_single_sign-on/7.4/html/getting_started_guide/).
   
2. Configure your RHSSO instance to integrate with GitLab and OpenShift. You can do this by setting up a new client in RHSSO for GitLab, where GitLab will act as an OAuth 2.0 client.

3. Configure GitLab to use RHSSO as its OAuth provider. Update the GitLab settings to reflect the RHSSO endpoints for authentication.

## Bootstrapping the Cluster

1. Modify the [root-app/app-of-apps.yaml](root-app/app-of-apps.yaml) file to replace any occurrences of `redhat-na-ssa` with your own GitLab group name.

2. Save, commit, and push your changes to the GitLab repository.

3. Authenticate as a `cluster-admin` on your OpenShift cluster and execute:

```shell
./bootstrap-scripts/cluster-bootstrap.sh
```

This script will:
 * Install OpenShift GitOps (ArgoCD)
 * Apply the ArgoCD root app
 * Kick off the cluster bootstrap process.

## Secret Management with HashiCorp Vault

1. Ensure your Vault instance is correctly configured by running the relevant Ansible playbook to populate Vault with the secrets required for GitLab and Quay integration:

```sh
ansible-playbook ansible-automation/playbooks/vault-setup/main.yaml
```

2. After making configuration changes, commit and push them to the GitLab repository. ArgoCD will automatically sync the changes on the OpenShift cluster.

## Additional Components

Once the cluster is bootstrapped, you can continue adding more components like OpenShift Pipelines, additional operators, and customized developer workflows as needed.
