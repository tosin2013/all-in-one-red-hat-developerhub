To redo the README for the Red Hat Developer Hub and incorporate RHSSO and GitLab instead of GitHub, you can modify the steps to reflect the use of RHSSO for authentication and GitLab for repository management and webhook functionality. Here's a revised version of the README:

# All-in-One Red Hat Developer Hub GitOps Cluster Bootstrap with RHSSO and GitLab

This project repo contains a set of ArgoCD manifests and Ansible Playbooks used to bootstrap a Developer Hub Environment on top of OpenShift v4.x. The environment is designed for Developer workflows demo.

It uses the ArgoCD **App of Apps pattern** to pre-install and configure a set of OpenShift Operators to support Developer Workflows.

The following components will be provisioned by ArgoCD in your cluster:
 * **OpenShift Dev Spaces**
 * **Kubernetes Image Puller Operator**
 * **Git Webhook Operator**
 * **HashiCorp Vault**
 * **Vault Config Operator**
 * **OpenShift Pipelines**
 * **Patch Operator**
 * **...** (this list can grow as needed for future components)

## First Steps

1. **Install the OpenShift GitOps Operator** on your OpenShift cluster - WIP
2. To deploy the Developer Hub, you can use the following command:
   ```bash
   oc apply -k  clusters/overlays/developerhub-4.16
   ```
